Below is a step-by-step guide on how to run your application by cloning the Git repository and using Docker (with Docker Compose).

---

## 1. Install prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed locally:

- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (to build and run the containers)

You can verify that everything is installed by running:
```bash
git --version
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

## 2. Clone the repository

Clone your repository using the correct URL (example below is just a placeholder; replace it with your actual repo URL):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
```

After cloning, you will have a folder named `<repository-name>`.

---

## 3. Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

Ensure that this directory contains the `docker-compose.yml` file (or the relevant Docker files).

---

## 4. Build and run containers

```bash
# 1) (Optional) Build images. This is sometimes needed if images 
#    are not already built or if you want a fresh rebuild:
docker-compose build --no-cache

# 2) Launch all services in detached mode:
docker-compose up -d
```

- The `--no-cache` option forces Docker to rebuild images without using cached layers.  
- The `-d` (detached mode) runs the containers in the background.  
- If you prefer to see the logs in real time, omit the `-d` flag (`docker-compose up`).

---

## 5. Check running containers

Use the following command to see the status of your services:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

If they are all running successfully, you should see a status of `Up`.

---

## 6. Inspect logs (if needed)

If something goes wrong or you want to see the container output, you can check logs for a specific service:

```bash
docker-compose logs <service-name>
```

Where `<service-name>` corresponds to one of the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` (for example, `airflow-webserver`, `postgres`, etc.).

---

## 7. Access the application

If your application provides a web interface, you can likely access it at `http://localhost:XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the port exposed in `docker-compose.yml`.

- For example, if you are running Airflow, you might access it at `http://localhost:8080` (if your `docker-compose.yml` maps port 8080).
- Adjust the port based on what you have in your Compose file.

---

## 8. Stop containers

When you're done, you can stop and remove containers (and networks) by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will remove the containers but preserve any volumes (if declared in the Compose file). Data stored in volumes remains on your local disk.

---

### Summary

1. **Clone** the repository (using `git clone`).
2. **Navigate** into the project folder.
3. **Build** Docker images if necessary (`docker-compose build`).
4. **Start** the containers (`docker-compose up -d`).
5. Open your **application** in a browser at the configured port.
6. **Stop** containers using `docker-compose down` when you are finished.
